## Read Quality Control
- Assuming that most QC tools are ready, it is time to use them to do the following:
  - Check the quality of the reads using `fastqc`.
  - Create a summary report of quality metrics using `multiqc`.
  - Trim poor read at a user-specified cutoff using `bbduk.sh`.
  - Remove contaminants `bbduk.sh`.
